Your Tasks:
Task 1: Offer a brief explanation of the following terms:
1. Text Mining
2. Text Classification
3. Text Clustering
4. Sentiment Analysis
Task 2: Data Cleansing, Classification, and Word Clouds.
1. Load the data into Python and perform the initial sanity checks.
2. Generate initial analytical visualizations to understand the reviews (i.e., histogram) including a word cloud (using the wordcloud package). Discuss your findings.
3. Classify reviews into two ‘sentiment’ categories called positive and negative.
4. Generate positive and negative word clouds. Discuss your findings while comparing the positive and negative summaries (you may include other graphs if needed).
Task 3: Prediction
1. Build a simple logistic regression model to predict the sentiment category based on a text-based review. Discuss your findings.
2. Build a multinomial logistic regression model to predict the rating of a book based on its text-based review. Discuss your findings.
